## Definitions 

**Abundance** is the number of individuals in a population or community.

**Change in Ratio** methods infer animal abundance from observing changes in proportions of certain sub-classes of the wildlife population like ... . after removing a known amount of individuals from the population. 

**Density** refers to the number of individuals within a certain area or volume. In the context of wildlife populations, it is typically used to describe the number of individuals per unit area.

**Distance sampling** is a statistical method used in ecology to estimate the abundance or density of a population by collecting data on the distances between observers and the individuals they detect.

**Capture-recapture** is an analytic framework to estimate abundance and density of wildlife population which relies on captures (or detections) and recaptures (or redetections) of individuals in a population. The analytic framework can be applied to many different survey techniques. 

**Passive acoustic surveying** is when specialized microphones are used to record animal vocalisations. Contrast this to active acoustic surveying where sound sources â€¦. 

**Plot sampling** entails dividing up a landscape into sampling units such as plots (or quadrats) or strips and counting all individuals of the target species within the sampling units. 

**Removal methods** rely on systematically removing groups of individual (i.e. samples) from the population and deriving abundance from the reduction in the amount of individuals removed over time. 

**Survey** in the context of SCR refers to the structured event of going out and placing detectors in a predefined arrangement and for a certain amount of time in order to collect data on a wildlife population. 

**Survey (or sampling) technique(s)** are methods used to detect/capture/record animals in the field. This includes techniques such as camera trapping, DNA sampling, visual observation and many more. In the context of acoustic surveying, this involves placing microphones in a habitat to record the vocalisations of a specific species. 

**Self-contained recording unit**  is a type of sound recording device used in passive acoustic surveying that is designed to record animal vocalisations. It is typically designed to be left in the field for extended periods of time and may be powered by batteries or solar panels, are often equipped with weather-resistant and durable housing to protect against the elements and wildlife. 

**Closed population** a group of individuals or entities within a defined area or system that remains constant over a specific period, meaning that no new members are added, and no existing members leave or die.

**Probability of detection**  is probability of observing a detection unit. For example, the probability of hearing a call if call is the detection unit, or the probability of detecting and animal (or group) if animal (or group) is the detection unit. There are various kinds of detection probabilities in SCR surveys, even for a single kind of detection unit. For example, there is the probability that a single detector detects a detection unit, and the probability that any detector in an array detects a detection unit, (a larger probability, obviously), and the probability that a detector makes a detection GIVEN the location of the animal, and the probability that certain detectors detect a detection unit while others don't (the probability of a particular "detection history").

**Imperfect detection** is a widespread phenomenon in ecological studies and refers to when the probability of detection is less than one. In ecological surveys, it is almost always impossible to observe or detect all individuals of the populations due to either the specific sampling technique, human error or other factors. Imperfect detection can lead to biased or incomplete results and requires specialized statistical methods to account for the uncertainties introduced by the incomplete observations.

**Detection histories** contain the detections and re-detections of calls across detector arrays. Usually contained in a dataframe with rows equal to the number of calls detected and a column for each detector.If a call was detected at a microphone, the corresponding enrty contains a "1" and if not, a zero.

**Buffer distance** is the minimum distance between detectors and the edge of the habitat mask. The distance should be large enough to plausibly include all detected animals. 

**Constant (or homogenous) density** refers to when animal locations are evenly spread out throughout the survey region. 

**Detection function** refers to the mathematical model used to describe the relationship between distance and detection probability, where distance is the distance between detectors and detected animal locations. 

**Habitat mask** is set of coordinates that form an area covering the detectors in an SCR survey. The extent of the mask is determined by the buffer distance. 

**Non-constant (or inhomogenous) density** refers to when animal locations are NOT evenly spread out, but occur in regions of varying density across the survey region. 

**Spatial capture-recapture** (SCR) is a statistical model for estimating animal abundance and density from capture history data. SCR models combines a model for the distribution of animals in space with a model for detection probability. By jointly modelling these aspects, SCR produce reliable density estimates.
